# Minesweeper

The game of Minesweeper is certainly not my own creation or unique idea, however, this code was written entirely by me.
Only Minesweeper.java is required, simply run the main method to begin.

Future Revisions:
  GUI
  Resolving issues including an inability to label a board other than 9x9
  Marking mines
  Ability to win once all mines have been tagged
  
 Written in JAVA by me
