# Minesweeper

The game of Minesweeper is certainly not my own creation or unique idea, however, this code was written entirely by me.
For the command-line experience only Minesweeper.java is required, simply run the main method to begin.
However, the newer version with interactive GUI can be played from MinesweeperGUI.java. It was built on top of the JavaFX library, so this is also required for execution.
